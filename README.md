# helm
Quickly switch between your development artifacts.


## Installation

Presently Helm uses [ActivityWatch]() to collect desktop interaction data.
To install it, please follow the [guide](https://activitywatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-from-source.html) **except** replace the first step with
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nickbradley/activitywatch.git
```
to clone my forked version of the project.
